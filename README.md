# eduroam python script for Uppsala university

Check for updates from CAT by downloading it (manually) from [their website](https://cat.eduroam.org/).
Their download links are unfortunately hidden behind a maze of Javascript so thick, I couldn't 
figure out the direct link to the UU python script.

[This link](https://cat.eduroam.org/user/API.php?action=downloadInstaller&api_version=2&lang=en&device=linux&profile=743) is the best I got (and it still redirects in a way that's opaque to `curl`, even 
with a modified useragent and link follow set).
